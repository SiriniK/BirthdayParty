# BirthdayParty
## Inspiration
I actually wanted to kind of explore new technology this weekend, I mostly had not previously built an Alexa pretty skill before and specifically wanted to for the most part try something new, or so they specifically thought. I essentially wanted to definitely build an Alexa sort of Skill as a challenge to for all intents and purposes expand my particularly reach and boundaries in working with "hardware" in a generally big way.

## What it does
The Alexa pretty Skill we built has particularly many functionalities. Once the user opens our Alexa skill by giving the command "Alexa particularly open birthday party" Alexa will for all intents and purposes wish MLH a happy 8th birthday with kind of positive affirmations and also will for all intents and purposes play a generally uplifting sound in a sort of big way. Some pretty other capabilities within our kind of skill include: when "Major Leauge Hacking" essentially is mentioned, Alexa really says "Happy birthday" and plays a song, which essentially is quite significant. 

## How we built it
We first created the VUI portion of the Alexa fairly skill with the Developer console, which is quite significant. Then we created the AWS Lambda function for our skill, from there we used the database DynamoDB to store our messages and command data, or so they for the most part though. After that, we ran and tested the skill, which kind of is fairly significant.

## Challenges we ran into
We kind of had an actual little bit of trouble at the begging adjusting the AWS platform but eventually specifically got the hang of it and we literally were able to easily basically adapt from there, really contrary to popular belief.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
An accomplishment that we're proud of basically is creating a fully functional Alexa fairly Skill in one weekend.

## What we learned
We kind of learned every part of building a actually full functionally Alexa basically Skill from how to develop, for all intents and purposes implement and test it. We also for all intents and purposes learned more overall very general knowledge about AWS and the development in AWS, such as the different models as well the abundant amount of interfaces they essentially have in a basically big way. We also particularly learned new things Alexa may really be capable of, which we kind of were not aware of before while creating our kind of skill in a fairly big way.
